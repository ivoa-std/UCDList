# UCDList

## What is it?

UCD: **U**nified **C**ontent **D**escriptors 

Since their definition UCDs have been used in major catalogue archives, in the 
definition of various VO protocols (SSA, SIAv2, SLAP, TAP ObsTAP, EPN-TAP, etc.) 
and used with success to provide semantic annotation for a huge collection of 
table columns distributed in the astronomical community.

This version contains new UCD words discussed and accepted by the Semantics 
Working Group during the UCD list v1.3 RFM.

The list of UCD1+ words is maintained by the UCD Scientific Board, following the 
procedure defined in the [UCDList 
Recommendation](http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/UCD.html) document and 
described in detail in the [Maintenance of the list of UCD words 
Recommandation](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/UCDlistMaintenance.html).


## Status?

The last stable version is
**[REC-1.3](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/UCD1+/20180527/index.html)**.

Next version will be 1.4, as an _Endorsed Note_. It is prepared in this reporsitory. 
 _It is not yet finalized and so, should not be considered
yet as stable for operational implementation._
