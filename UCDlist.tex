controlled vocabulary-Updated List of terms Version 1.4}

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{5}  

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
This document describes the \emph{list of controlled terms}  building up the corpus of the Unified Content Descriptors, Version 1+ (UCD1+). 

The document describing the UCD1+ principles can be found at the URL: \url{https://ivoa.net/documents/UCD1+/20180527/index.html}. 
It is an IVOA Recommendation. 
The process to maintain and enrich the UCD list of terms is standardized in  \url{https://ivoa.net/documents/UCDlistMaintenance/}.
It states that successive versions of the UCD1+ vocabulary are distributed in Endorsed Notes within the IVOA.

The changes with respect to the version UCDList1.4 have been discussed in the request for modification (RFM) page on (\url{https://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/UCDList_1-5_RFM}) within the IVOA Semantics WG and validated by the UCD science board.
Each addition, amendment, etc.  is discussed now using VEP-UCD available from the RFM page  inspired from the set-up of Vocabulary Enhancement VEP2.0 specification (\url{https://ivoa.net/documents/Vocabularies/20210525/index.html}). 
VEP-UCD files are referenced from the RFM page and available for further details.

\section{Introduction}

A UCD is a string which contains textual tokens called `words', separated by semicolons(;). A word is 
composed of `atoms', separated by periods(.). The hierarchy is as follows: 
$$
\textrm{atoms} \rightarrow \textrm{words} \rightarrow \textrm{composed words}
$$
UCD1+ are either single words, or a composition of several words.

UCDs are ``controlled'' through a process defined in the IVOA. See \citet{2005ivoa.spec.0819D} and 
section \ref{sec:words} below. Control is exercised at the level of words (UCD1+) and at the level 
of the vocabulary (atoms) used to form words. A consistent list of atoms will be maintained, making 
sure that the same atom always means the same thing, even if used in combination with different other 
atoms. 


\section{List of valid words}
\label{sec:list}

All words are preceded by a `syntax' code that can help in the process of building composed UCD1+.
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``P'' means that the word can only be used as ``primary'' or first word;
\item ``S'' stands for only secondary: the word cannot be used as the first word to describe a 
single quantity;
\item ``Q'' means that the word can be used indifferently as first or secondary word;

The following cases behave as Q prefix and can be combined  as primary or secondary.
They specialize the combination rules:  
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``E'' means a photometric quantity, and can be followed by a word describing a part of 
	the electromagnetic spectrum;
	\item ``C'' is a colour index, and can be followed by two successive word describing a part of 
	the electromagnetic spectrum;
	\item ``V'' stands for vector. Such a word can be followed by another describing the axis or 
	reference frame in which the measurement is done.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

For typographic reasons some long UCD atoms are printed on two
lines in the following table.  In these cases, \texttt{some.long...
...ucd.x} is to be read as \texttt{some.long.ucd.x}.

\section{Definition of atoms and words}

\subsection{Definition of atoms}
Atoms are defined following these guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Abbreviations are used in contexts where their meaning is unambiguous. ({\bf ra}, {\bf dec} are 
acceptable, but {\bf t} is ambiguous: {\bf time} and {\bf temperature} are used instead.)
\item Atoms are not hyphenated. The separation is marked by a capital letter to help readability 
(position angle = {\bf posAng}) unless the composed word has a well- known acronym (signal to noise ratio = 
{\bf snr}) or short form (standard deviation = {\bf stdev}). There are only two exceptions to this rule: 
(i) the X-ray band ({\bf em.X-ray}) and (ii) the frequency / wavelength intervals defining regions of the 
e.m.~spectrum (e.g., {\bf em.radio.3-6GHz}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Definition of words}
\label{sec:words}

The list of UCD1+ words is evolving following the requirements of new datasets distributed in the 
IVOA ecosystem. The last iteration on the list included new terms for planetary data and was 
published in an IVOA REC specification \citep{2018ivoa.spec.0527PM}.

It is maintained following advice from a UCD Scientific Board, and published as an Endorsed Note 
from version 1.4 onwards following the procedure recommended in \citep{2019ivoa.spec.1007G}. 

\section{The structure of the UCD1+ tree}
All existing UCD1+ words are grouped into 12 main categories. These categories are expressed by the 
first atom of the word, whose possible values are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf arith} (arithmetics)\\ This section includes concepts involving or indicating some 
mathematical operation performed on the primary `concept' or just the presence of an arithmetic 
factor or operator.
\item {\bf em} (electromagnetic spectrum)\\ This section describes the electromagnetic spectrum, 
either in a monochromatic way or in predefined intervals. The complete list of proposed bands (in 
seven classical regions of the electromagnetic spectrum: radio, millimetre, infrared, optical, 
ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma- ray), can be found in the document 
\url{https://wiki.ivoa.net/internal/IVOA/IvoaUCD/NoteEMSpectrum-20040520.html}
\item {\bf instr} (instrument)\\ This section includes all quantities related to astronomical 
instrumentation, e.g. detectors (plates, CCDs, etc.), spectrographs, and telescopes (including 
observatories or missions), etc.
\item {\bf meta} (metadata)\\ This section includes all the information that is not coming directly 
from a measurement, and information that could not be included in other sections.
\item {\bf obs} (observation)\\ In principle under this section should go all words describing an 
observation (the name of the observer or PI, the observing conditions, the name of the field). In 
practice, this section helps to identify concepts related to an observation process.
\item {\bf phot} (photometry)\\ All the words describing photometric measures are included in this 
section. The definitions distinguish between a flux density (flux per unit frequency interval), a 
flux density integrated over a given electromagnetic spectrum interval (flux if expressed linearly, 
mag if expressed by a log), or a flux expressed in counts/s (if the setup of the detector is photon 
counting observing mode). `Colors', which are differences of magnitudes (i.e. ratios of fluxes) 
measured in different bandpasses, are also included.
\item {\bf phys} (physics)\\ This section includes atomic and molecular data (mainly used for 
spectroscopy) and basic physical quantities (temperature, mass, gravity, luminosity, etc.)
\item {\bf pos} (positional data)\\ This section describes all quantities related to the position of 
an object on the sky, or on a celestial body:
\begin{itemize}
\item Angular coordinates, and projections from spherical to rectangular systems.
\item Angular measurements in general (the angular size of an object is in this section, its linear 
size is in the {\bf phys} section).
\item The World Coordinate System FITS keywords.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf spect} (spectral data)\\ For historical reasons, photometric data taken in narrow spectral 
bands with instruments called spectrographs are classified as spectroscopic data ({\bf spect}). These 
definitions should not be confused with those in the {\bf em} category: {\bf em} represents the independent 
variable, or dispersion axis; whereas {\bf phot} and {\bf spect} describe dependent variables, like a 
flux density under the {\bf phot} branch, or a spectral line intensity in the {\bf spect} branch.  
\item {\bf src} (source)\\ This is a rather generic section, mainly devoted to source classifications.
Variability, orbital, and velocity data are also included in this section.
\item {\bf stat} (statistics)\\ This section includes statistical information on measurements.
\item {\bf time} (time)\\ Quantities related to time (age, date, period, etc.) are described in this 
section.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Combining UCD words}
\subsection{Goal}
Since their definition UCDs have been used in major catalogue archives, in the definition of various
VO protocols (SSA, SIAv2, SLAP, TAP ObsTAP, EPN-TAP, etc.) and used with success to provide semantic
annotation for a huge collection of table columns distributed in the astronomical community.

The list of terms has increased and the usage of UCD combination has become very common. This leads
to a richer set of rules in the assigning and checking tools developed at CDS with VO partners.

In order to keep the consistency in the UCD thesaurus, each rule is adjusted and weighted considering 
the physical usage of the quantities represented in table columns, so the pertinence increases with 
the context. Initially used for source catalogues (Vizier, Heasarc archives, etc.) in the first place, 
they are now also used in VOTable documents for planetary data \citep{wd:epntap,erard-vespa} and all sorts of metadata.

\subsection{Remarks on combination rules}
The combination rules have been defined in the first IVOA documents defining UCD concept
\citep{2005ivoa.spec.0819D} and refined in the last UCD1+ standard recommendation \citep{2018ivoa.spec.0527PM}. 
They are exposed with a syntax tag given as a property of each UCD word 
and included in the list of UCD words. See Section \ref{sec:list} with the tags definitions on top.

They correspond to real usage of the terms in science publications and are attached to the description 
of catalogues’ column by experimented data scientists. UCD combination also reflects the catalogues 
build-up strategy. Errors and statistics, for instance, are provided with measurement values; measures 
and model comparison are evaluated with error fits, precision, etc. All the scientific knowledge helps 
to define appropriate UCD words combination.

The assigning tool proposed at \url{http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/UCD/cgi-bin/descr2ucd} is based on the
pragmatic encoding of physical quantities found in science papers and data attached to publications.

\section{Current questions about combinations of UCDs}
\subsection{How do UCDs differ from structured descriptions?}

UCDs do not provide a structured representation of table content but the meaning or relative class 
concept known at the time for the astronomical speciality. Therefore, the structure of words and 
their rules for combination do not follow any object oriented paradigm, in contradiction to any 
reference to a data model item (Utype, VO-DML type /role definition), which are dependent of a 
defined and endorsed IVOA data model specification.

\subsection{P or S syntax code: Which is the most pertinent position for a UCD word?}
P, S and Q are the labels expressing in which position of a UCD expression a term can be used, P 
in first place, S as suffix, and Q in both allowed position: head and tail. The UCD list defines 
the recommended position for each word with some flexibility.

P is always what matters the most to describe a quantity, i.e., the kind of property that should be 
searched for in primary order, and the most relevant UCD words to represent a quantity.

S is the code for the qualifying part of the UCD, the secondary information appended to specify 
the first UCD term.

%All the codes are explained and given in the list of UCD terms in Appendix A. 
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item Give me all columns / all catalogues with a column having a magnitude in R: {\tt magnitude} 
is the primary concept and band R is the secondary concept, so the ucd to search for is 
{\tt phot.mag;em.opt.R}.
\item Give me all columns with an error on magnitude B: here we shall use a query with ucd 
equals to {\tt stat.error;phot.mag;em.opt.B}. Here the main concept attached to the column 
value is error, qualified by {\tt phot.mag}, itself qualified by {\tt em.opt.B}.
\end{itemize}
Concatenation can apply more than one time, depending on ordering rules. See \citet{2005ivoa.spec.0819D}, section 3.3, 
for other details.

\section{Associated Files}
This document comes with two plain text files:
\texttt{ucd-list.txt}\footnote{\auxiliaryurl{ucd-list.txt}} and 
\texttt{ucd-list-deprecated.txt}\footnote{\auxiliaryurl{ucd-list-deprecated.txt}}. 
Their content is described below. 

\subsection{UCD List file}
The \texttt{ucd-list.txt} file is a plain text formatted table with
three columns.
It is the source file of Table \ref{table:ucd-list}.

The columns are separated by \texttt{|} (pipe) characters. From left to right, the 
columns contain, respectively, the \emph{syntax code}, the \emph{UCD word}, and its
\emph{description}. 

\subsection{Deprecated UCD List file}
The \texttt{ucd-list-deprecated.txt} file is a plain text formatted table with two
columns separated by a whitespace character. The first column contains the deprecated 
UCD words, while the second contains word that should be used instead.

Comment rows are starting with a \texttt{\#} (hash) character.

\subsection{Changes from v0.1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Descriptions of the words were improved.
\item Designation of commonly used lines have been moved to {\tt em.line.*}. As a consequence, terms like 
{\tt em.IR.K.Brgamma} or {\tt spect.index.Hbeta} have been removed.
\item {\tt phys.at} and {\tt phys.mol} have been completely reorganized to improve the overall description 
of this domain. A new branch {\tt phys.atmol} has been introduced to group concepts shared between {\tt 
phys.at} and {\tt phys.mol}.
\item The {\tt phot.color} section was significantly simplified.
\item Missing nodes of the tree were added (e.g. {\tt em.gamma}, {\tt em.mm}, {\tt pos.sg}).
\item Creation of new words: {\tt em.wavenumber}, {\tt meta.ucd}, {\tt stat.error.sys}.
\item Typos were corrected in {\tt em.opt.*} units and a few other descriptions.
\end{enumerate}
